===============================

Stores and opens commonly used sets of tabs.

-----------

Window Manager keeps track of the tabs that are open in each window in Chrome
and allows you to close or reopen them. Whenever a window is closed, it's
tabs are saved in Window Manager and can be instantly restored with a single
click.

To create a new set of tabs, simply open a new window in Chrome (Ctrl-N or
Command-N). These sets of tabs can then be renamed, closed, opened or deleted.

It also allows easy navigation between open windows. The icon of each tab
within the window is displayed and the name/URL can be shown by hovering the
cursor over the icon.
